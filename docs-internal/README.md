# Plinth · Internal Project Documentation

You are an AI agent (or human) picking this project up cold. Read this file
first, then jump to the role document that matches your task.

## What Plinth is

A typed product-data primitive for software agents. One call turns a URL,
a GTIN, or a fuzzy name into a typed product object with per-field
confidence, the per-call cost stamped in the response, and an MCP +
x402 surface so an autonomous agent can discover and pay for it without
human signup.

**Status (2026-06-21): live and in private beta.** All four tools, key
auth, metering, rate limiting, the dashboard, Stripe billing, and x402
settlement on Base Sepolia are deployed. App at https://plinth-tan.vercel.app
(custom domain `onplinth.io` provisioning). The developer-facing front door
is the repo-root [README.md](../README.md).

## The five wedges (memorise these)

1. **MCP-native + x402 micropayments.** Diffbot, Zyte, Bright Data, Firecrawl all require an account and an API key. We expose the same tools over MCP and accept USDC on Base per call.
2. **Cost stamped in the response.** Every call returns `cost_usd`. Competitors charge opaque credit bundles.
3. **Per-field confidence with a cache gate.** Confidence is computed per field and overall. Only results with overall confidence ≥ 0.7 are cached.
4. **Price as a band, not a number.** `{ low, high, currency, as_of, n_sources }`. We refuse to pretend a single scraped number is the truth.
5. **One typed schema across URL, GTIN, and fuzzy name.** Most stacks compose 2 to 3 vendors to cover these three lookup modes.

If you change any of these, update this file AND `docs-internal/product.md`.

## Public docs

The repo-root [README.md](../README.md) is the developer front door (quickstart, tools, auth).
Customer-facing docs live at `/docs/*` (file routes under `src/routes/docs.*.tsx`). The
North Star and stop conditions are in [../docs/KILL-CRITERIA.md](../docs/KILL-CRITERIA.md).
Internal docs (this directory) carry the "why" and the things we will never put on a marketing page.

## Keeping docs in sync

This README is the load-bearing index. When you change a load-bearing
rule here (or in any role doc), update this README in the same pass.
