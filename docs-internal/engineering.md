# Engineering

## Stack

- **Framework:** TanStack Start (React 19, SSR, file-based routing) on Vite, built with Nitro.
- **Hosting:** Vercel (Node / Fluid Compute functions, not edge). `main` auto-deploys; PRs get
  preview deploys. `src/server.ts` is the Nitro entry.
- **Styling:** Tailwind v4 via `src/styles.css`, semantic tokens only (Editorial Warm).
- **Backend:** Supabase, project `cgkcplcamsijghalintq` (own project; Lovable has been ejected).
  Postgres 17, RLS on every table, PostgREST, Auth, `pg_cron` for the cache purge and the daily
  ops rollup / kill-floor check.
- **Extraction:** a separate worker (see below). The core extractor path is deterministic-first;
  an LLM content-validity check runs only on the ambiguous tail (behind `PLINTH_LLM_VERIFY`, with a
  conservative fallback), and `resolve_product` uses Exa for name retrieval.

## Architecture (request path)

```
agent / MCP client
  -> app on Vercel  (src/routes/api/v1/*, /api/mcp)
       auth (plk_ key) -> rate limit -> entitlement_check (402 quota/cost fuse)
       -> worker on Vercel  (POST /extract, Bearer PLINTH_EXTRACTOR_TOKEN)
            fetch (browser UA, never throws)
            deterministic extractors: JSON-LD, Shopify, OpenGraph, barcode/GTIN
            [unblock fallback: Bright Data Web Unlocker, blocked pages only, DORMANT]
            [render fallback: Browserless, only when no strong structured data]
            content-validity stage (isproduct.ts): deterministic-first + Haiku verifier
            confidence.ts (raw score) -> calibrate.ts (calibrated probability) -> 0.7 gate
       <- typed ProductEnvelope
       meter into usage_events (billable + calibration stamps), mint/return plinth_id
```

The app never extracts; it proxies to the worker over HTTPS with `PLINTH_EXTRACTOR_TOKEN`. Keeping
extraction out of the SSR app keeps the app functions small and lets the worker run heavy work
elsewhere.

## Route + server-function conventions

- File names use dots (`dashboard.billing.tsx` -> `/dashboard/billing`).
- `_authenticated/route.tsx` guards dashboard routes.
- Customer-callable HTTP endpoints are `createFileRoute(...).server.handlers`. Server-only modules
  (`*.server.ts`, anything importing `supabaseAdmin` or secrets) are dynamically imported inside the
  handler so they never reach the client bundle.
- App-internal mutations use `createServerFn` in `*.functions.ts`, chaining
  `.middleware([requireSupabaseAuth])`; admin surfaces also check `has_role(auth.uid(), 'admin')`.
- `src/start.ts` registers `attachSupabaseAuth` globally; do not remove.
- `routeTree.gen.ts` is generated at build. After adding a route, build before committing so the
  committed tree includes it (and tsc stays green).

## read_product path (representative)

`read_product` validates the `plk_` key, enforces the per-plan rate limit, calls `entitlement_check`
(402 with an upgrade link on `quota_exceeded` / `cost_fuse`, BEFORE any worker cost), proxies
`{ url | gtin, min_confidence? }` to the worker, and meters the call into `usage_events`. The metering
row is a calibration observation, not just a billable count: it stamps `confidence`, `product_returned`,
`billable` (product present AND confidence >= 0.7), `domain`/method, `envelope_hash`, `request_id`, and
`calibration_version`. The write is awaited (serverless freezes the function after the response).

## External worker (the engine)

A separate deploy (`krishanraja/plinth-worker`, Vercel, Node). `worker/src/`:

- **`server.ts`** exposes `POST /extract` (Bearer `PLINTH_EXTRACTOR_TOKEN`, constant-time check,
  fails closed without the token) and `GET /health`.
- **`extract.ts`** deterministic extractors: JSON-LD (schema.org Product across arrays / `@graph`),
  OpenGraph, and Shopify (`/products/{handle}.json` for fields plus `/meta.json` for currency so a
  real price band forms). Fetch uses a standard **browser User-Agent** (a self-identified bot UA was
  served block pages and scored real products at 0) and NEVER throws: a network error, timeout, or
  block returns a sentinel (status 0, empty HTML) so the orchestrator degrades to a clean null
  envelope. A final URL on a different host is flagged `redirected` (soft-redirect trap).
- **`barcode.ts`** GTIN / barcode lookup against authoritative catalogs.
- **`render.ts`** headless-render fallback (Browserless), used only when a page exposes no strong
  structured data to a plain fetch (JS-injected JSON-LD). It NEVER force-renders high-anti-bot
  domains (Amazon, Walmart, Target, Best Buy, eBay): structured-data-only there.
- **`unblock.ts`** Bright Data Web Unlocker fallback for bot-hostile retailers that block the
  datacenter IP. Fallback-only (escalates once, only when the plain fetch looks blocked and no strong
  structured source was found), pay-per-success, cost stamped. DORMANT unless `BRIGHTDATA_API_TOKEN`
  and `BRIGHTDATA_ZONE` are set.
- **`isproduct.ts`** the content-validity stage: "is this ONE specific, purchasable product?"
  Deterministic-first (hard non-products such as 404 / homepage / listing / off-host redirect
  collapse to ~0; title + price + id scores ~0.98), with a Haiku 4.5 verifier (`PLINTH_LLM_VERIFY`,
  `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`) only on the genuinely ambiguous tail. If the verifier is unavailable, an
  ambiguous page falls back BELOW the gate, so an unverified page is never served as trusted.
- **`confidence.ts`** the aggregation rewrite. Noisy-or over method priors (OpenGraph prior raised
  to 0.72, not structurally capped), titles clustered by normalized Jaccard similarity so a benign
  `" | Brand"` suffix is not a conflict, and identity = title plus its single best corroborator
  (price, id, or brand). This killed the old coverage trap that capped a title-only product at ~0.686.
  The content-validity score multiplies in, so a 404 with an `og:title` collapses to ~0.
- **`calibrate.ts` + `calibration.json`** isotonic calibration. Maps the raw score to a calibrated
  probability P(returned product is correct), fitted on the golden CALIBRATE split. After this,
  `confidence` is a probability: 0.7 means "at least 70% likely correct", which is the North Star
  unit. Absent a fit, calibration is the identity so the engine still runs. `calibration_version` is
  stamped on every response and metering row.
- **`resolve.ts`** fuzzy-name resolution: Exa neural search to candidate URLs, then extract the best,
  letting the content-validity stage make the final call per candidate. Returns nothing when Exa is
  out of credits.

Measured on a held-out golden test split: precision at gate 1.0 (Wilson lower bound 0.832),
adversarial rejection 1.0, GTIN recall 1.0, zero crashes. See `worker/docs/decisions/og-scope.md` for
the A-reduced coverage scope (structured data + verified OpenGraph; bot-hard retailers best-effort).

## Env vars (app)

- `PLINTH_EXTRACTOR_URL`, `PLINTH_EXTRACTOR_TOKEN` -- the worker.
- `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`, `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` -- billing.
- `X402_RECIPIENT` -- the Base Sepolia (testnet) payee. `X402_FACILITATOR`, `X402_NETWORK`,
  `X402_ASSET`, `X402_PRICE_ATOMIC` are optional (sane Base Sepolia defaults live in `x402.server.ts`).
- `APP_ORIGIN` (in `src/config/product.ts`) / `APP_BASE_URL` -- absolute base for redirect and quota
  links. Point at `https://onplinth.io` once DNS resolves; today the live surface is
  `plinth-tan.vercel.app`.
- Supabase URL + publishable key (`VITE_*`) for the client; service role for server-only admin.

Worker env: `PLINTH_EXTRACTOR_TOKEN`, `EXA_API_KEY` (resolve), `BROWSERLESS_API_KEY` (render),
`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` + `PLINTH_LLM_VERIFY` (content-validity verifier), `BRIGHTDATA_API_TOKEN` +
`BRIGHTDATA_ZONE` (Web Unlocker, dormant), Supabase service role. `process.env.*` is server-only:
read it inside the handler, never at shared-module scope.

## Local dev and deploy

```bash
bun install
bunx tsc --noEmit
bun run build      # also regenerates routeTree.gen.ts
bun run lint
```

Ship: branch, PR, green CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`: gitleaks `secret-scan`, plus install, em-dash
grep on `src/`, tsc, build; lint runs non-blocking pending a one-time prettier pass), squash-merge.
Vercel deploys `main` automatically. Migrations are applied to `cgkc` via the Supabase Management API /
MCP and mirrored into `supabase/migrations/`.
